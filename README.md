 IoT Door Lock and Opening Device
Overview
This project is an IoT-based door locking and unlocking system using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a relay module. The system allows users to remotely control a door lock via a web interface. The ESP8266 is connected to a relay module that drives the locking mechanism, and the web interface communicates with Firebase to manage lock status in real-time.

Components Used
ESP8266: Microcontroller for WiFi connectivity and control of the relay.
Relay Module: Controls the electronic lock.
Firebase Realtime Database: Stores and retrieves lock status data.
Web Interface: HTML file (index.html) to remotely lock/unlock the door.
Power Supply: Powers the ESP8266 and relay module
